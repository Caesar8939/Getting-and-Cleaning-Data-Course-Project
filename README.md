The homework for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Class

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The homework project for this class (Getting and Cleaning Data) was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, do an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

Below are the necessary homework requirements that must be performed before running the R script:
1.Download the zip file from this URL.
2.Unzip the file.
3.Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script: ◦ features.txt 
◦ subject_train.txt 
◦ subject_test.txt 
◦ X_train.txt 
◦ X_test.txt 
◦ y_train.txt 
◦ y_test.txt 

After the requirements above have been completed, I ran the R script (run_analysis.R). 
The output of the run_analysis.R script is tidy.csv.

The cook book will further provide more about the data and the analysis.
